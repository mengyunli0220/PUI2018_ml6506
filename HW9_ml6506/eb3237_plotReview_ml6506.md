### CLARITY
You did a very good job! The topic is very interesting. The two plots, from two different angles, show us dynamics of the medium house price in texas for the last 12 months. It is easy for me to get information from the second plot. I counld know the price trendency, the price differences between cities as well as the exact price of each month and city. However, for the first plot, since you put 12 months data in one bar for each city, it may be difficult to read the number. 

### ESTHETIC
These two plots all look beautiful. However, I think there are something could be improved.
For fisrt plot:  Since you put 12 months data in one bar for each city, it may look disorder and very diffcult to track one specific month data.
For second plot: This plot looks so good! But I think it maybe better to put the legend to the side of the plot rather than put it in the middle of the plot.

### HONESTY
The plot is honestly reproducing the data. 

### Suggestions
The plot looks very good but I think there is one thing worth to be suggested. Compare this two plot, we could find they convey the same information and the second one is more clear. In this case, we could only keep one plot.
