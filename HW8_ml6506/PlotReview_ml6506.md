Mengyun's visualization is fairly effective in showing the distribution of subway distribution of New York City. Initially, it is really clear plot. Audience can easily determine that midtown and downtown Manhattan has much better subway accesses than other areas. However, although it is important to use the "equal interval" scheme, 7 intervals (k=7) seems to be redundant. Mengyun may consider to use only 5 or less intervals (k<= 5), which would be enough to describe the information. Furthermore, for the data preparation process of this plot, Mengyun may consider to divide the number of subway station by the population of the according area. This may helps showing the subway station density in NYC more correctly. Eventually, Mengyun could also use a different color map to make it plot more clear. Most parts of the current plot are too dark, which making audience difficult to tell the difference. Besides the plot, Mengyun could also include more descriptions and her insight about this visualization in the caption.
